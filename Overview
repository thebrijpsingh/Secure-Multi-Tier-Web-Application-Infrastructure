Objective:
The goal is to design and deploy a secure, scalable infrastructure for hosting web applications. The infrastructure will consist of three tiers: the web server, application server, and database server. Each tier will be secured with firewalls and configured to communicate only with the relevant layers, ensuring minimal attack surfaces.

Project Components:
- Web server (Nginx or Apache)
- Application server (PHP or Node.js)
- Database server (MySQL or PostgreSQL)
- SSL encryption (Let's Encrypt)
- Security (Firewall, SSH hardening)
